# My System Configurations using Ansible

This repository contains system configurations that are used to efficiently configure new remote virtual machines and ensure they are up and running smoothly.

### Why Ansible
By using Ansible as our configuration management tool, we can achieve better maintainability, scalability, and reliability compared to a traditional bash script approach.

Advantages of using Ansible:
1. Simplicity: Ansible uses a simple and human-readable syntax, making it easier to write and understand configuration code.
2. Idempotence: Ansible ensures that the desired state of the system is achieved regardless of the initial state, making it safe to run the configuration code multiple times.
3. Scalability: Ansible allows us to manage configurations across multiple systems simultaneously, making it suitable for large-scale deployments.
4. Reusability: Ansible playbooks can be modularized and reused across different projects, reducing duplication of effort.
5. Auditing and Reporting: Ansible provides built-in auditing and reporting capabilities, allowing us to track changes and monitor the state of our systems.
